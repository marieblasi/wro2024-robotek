### 2.2 Why Python and C++?

Python and C++ are two widely used languages, representing the best of both worlds. While one is used for fast and flexible development, the other can be implemented for tasks that require high performance. However, together they provide a solution for a system like ours, where we need to control hardware while efficiently processing data at the same time.

1. ***Complementing the strengths of both languages:*** Python is known for being a high-level language, easy to write and read, and excellent for rapid development, proof of concepts, and handling complex tasks such as data analysis, hardware control, and machine learning. C++, on the other hand, is highly efficient in terms of speed and optimization, making it ideal for performance-critical tasks like real-time sensor handling and signal processing.
2. ***Management of libraries:*** Both languages contain a large number of easy-to-use libraries, ranging from web interface management, computer vision, and network handling to direct hardware manipulation. This allows for efficient work and rapid development of advanced functionalities without having to program them from scratch.
3. ***Use in different platforms:*** We can use Python on boards like the Raspberry Pi for general control tasks, vision, etc., where Python is commonly used because it offers extensive libraries that facilitate interaction with the operating system. In the case of C++, it will be used on Arduino. Microcontrollers like the one we will use are typically programmed in C++ because this language allows for more precise control, lower memory usage, and lower latency, which is essential when working with limited resources and tasks that require high efficiency, such as handling sensors in real time.
4. ***Performance and flexibility:*** C++ for better performance, such as sensor reading and processing; and Python for greater flexibility in handling advanced logic, such as data manipulation and integration with interfaces. This way, the versatility and communication of both libraries are fully leveraged.

## 3. Our road to success!

### *3.1 Designing the prototype*

We started by making a carton-prototype based on the turning mechanism and following the official documentation rules. This was our initial prototype:

![prototype](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06523245-8f3e-4c9d-9fc8-b9322338aac1)

> [!TIP]
> In order to choose the apropiate materials, we made a design and a table of components with all our options. Then, we selected the ones that seemed the most efficient to us.

![drawingPrototype](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cda5ee6-cf6c-44be-bf7e-c29f5a3abca0)
![materialsSchemes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58097104-9be4-432f-a44f-7228804fc0a0)

We decided to use these components:

### Reasons for choosing our sensors

By choosing **QTR-1A** and **Sharp GP2Y0A21** sensors, you ensure precise, reliable, and cost-effective solutions for our robot.

+ QTR-1A Sensors:

  1. ***Fast response and high precision for line detection:*** We need a high-speed robot that operates in fast-moving applications. Having the need of real-time feedback for quick adjustments and control, we chose the sensor for its rapid signal process and using the infrared LED and phototransistor pair we detect the surface lines and light.
  2. ***Compact and low power consumption:*** The small footprint allows easy integration into compact designs without adding extra weight and, also, help us optimize energy efficiency in battery-operated systems like ours, allowing us to conserve battery life for the competition.
 
+ Sharp GP2Y0A21 IR Sensors:

  1. ***Accurate distance measurement:*** It can be integrated with microcontrollers and other analog signal processing systems to provide precise distance readings in the obstacle detection task by using the infrared triangulation technology to measure distances from 10 cm to 80 cm 
  2. ***Reliable and durable:*** The sensor is known for its long-lasting performance and efficiently operation in a wide range of conditions, not only during variations in temperature or humidity, but when there is light interference from the surrounding environment, too, wichi we think could possibly happen during the competition.

### *3.2 Code for the camera*

First, we open our repository on *Visual Studio Code* by cloning it into a folder we had:
```
cd projects

git clone https://github.com/marieblasi/wro2024-robotek.git

ls wro2024-robotek
```
We installed *Python* in *Visual Studio* and imported the libraries:
```
import cv2
from PIL import Image
from util import get_limits
```
Then, we set our camera and wrote the code:
```
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)   # setting up the camera we will use

red = [40, 20, 150]   # setting up the colors we need to detect
blue = [30, 20, 150]

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    hsvImage = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
    lowerLimit, upperLimit = get_limits(color=red)
    mask = cv2.inRange(hsvImage, lowerLimit, upperLimit)   # changing the color format (RGB to HSV)
    mask_ = Image.fromarray(mask)
    bbox = mask_.getbbox()

    if bbox is not None:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = bbox
        frameWithBbox = cv2.rectangle(frame, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 5)   # establishing our internal frame
        cv2.imshow("frame", frameWithBbox)   # showing the frame 
    else:
        cv2.imshow("frame", frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break
```
***Overview of the operation:***

Our main goal was to use the camera to descompose the image it sees into pixels. It firstly detected the color in RGB format, but then was converted it into a new HSV format. Once the color code in HSV is obtained, we compared it with a specific range of values. If the desired color is within our palette, it will be highlighted with an internal frame within the camera, looking like this:

### *3.3 Printing the prototype and ensambling*

We proceeded to print our first prototype using 3D printing. Once we had all the parts ready, we began the assembly process: we added the motors and the wheels, selected to ensure proper traction and optimal movement.  

![printed prototype](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dca1240a-ef3a-4b02-b663-73f74957ab60)

---
### *3.4 Code for the Raspberry PI 4*

We usedd the MicroSD card to connect to one of the computers, which we then linked to the Wi-Fi network. We configured its MicroSD card and began developing the code. This includes the modules for `motor.py`, `detectColors.py`, `ser.py`, and `main.py`.

---
### *3.5 Code for the motors*

In `motor.py`, we implemented the forward and backward motor functions: FORWARDS and BACKWARDS. We developed the turning logic using the Stepper motor control (LEFT and RIGHT) and created a sequence using a 'for' loop to manage the Stepper motor movement.

> [!NOTE]
> In the end, we decided to change the motor model to improve its efficiency. However, the code remains the same.

---
### *3.6 Code for the Arduino*

We used an Arduino Nano and developed the `analogsensor.ino` code, which, along with Sharp sensors, allowed us to measure distance from three different angles: front, left, and right. We collected the data and printed it to the serial port for monitoring. Subsequently, we connected the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi and, through the code in `ser.py`, read and processed the data provided by the sensors.

---
### *3.7 Designing and printing the second prototype*

We redesigned the prototype after realizing that we needed to adapt the new components to the cart. We 3D printed only the essential parts, such as the steering system and motor mounts, while the rest was cut from acrylic to keep the structure light and sturdy.

![printed prototype 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b2bdaf5-1f30-4a61-9fc3-0eed9f7d6961)

---
### *3.8 Designing and printing the last prototype*

We printed the prototype for the third and final time, adding an additional level to better distribute the components and provide a mount for the webcam. We also slightly modified the design of the motor mount to fit the PowerBank, ensuring a perfect fit and a more efficient arrangement of all elements.

> [!NOTE]
> To optimize performance and extend the cart's runtime, we decided to replace the traditional batteries with LiPo cells.
