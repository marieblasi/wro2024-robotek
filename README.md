Hello! My name is Isa and I am from Peru. I love music (singing and playing the guitar), making origami, and painting. A fun fact about me is that I sang in the National Theather wearing pijamas when I was 6.

## Why did we choose to participate?

We see this project as more than just a competition. It is a chance to be creative, work together, and overcome challenges—both in the design and in ourselves. By designing our robot, we are not creating just a machine but a mixture of our electronic and coding skills, and innovation.

This experience has reminded us that endorsing difficulties means finding solutions where others see problems and that we can have fun and enjoy the process. So, we thank being part of this olympiad: it has pushed us beyond the limits, broadening our minds, and, most of all, we had a great time!

## Preparing the repo

### *Designing the prototype*

We started by making a carton-prototype based on the turning mechanism and following the official documentation rules. This was our initial prototype:

In order to choose the apropiate materials, we made a design and a table of components with all our options. Then, we selected the ones that seemed the most efficient to us.

+ ⁠TT Motor (Blue)
+ ⁠Stepper Motor 28YBJ-48
+ ⁠Driver ULN2003
+ Driver TB6612
+ Breadboard Power Supply Model Adapter Shield MB102 3.3v/5v
+ Power Bank: 5v 3A 10000 mAh
+ ⁠QTR-1A Sensors
+ ⁠IR Sensors Sharp GP2Y0A21
+ ⁠Webcam
+ Capacitor 10uF
