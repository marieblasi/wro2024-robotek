__3D-Printed Models__
====
An important factor in our project was the creation of 3D-printed models specifically designed to securely hold sensors and mechanical parts in place. These custom designs provided precise alignment and reduced potential obstructions. Furthermore, we employed 3D printing to fabricate durable yet lightweight structural elements, enabling us to customize the vehicle's design to meet our requirements without compromising on strength or flexibility.
